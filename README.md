# .dotfiles
My common dotfiles with config including git, bash, zsh, vim, emacs, vscode and other tools I commonly use for development.

# Usage
1. First clone the repository to your home directory
```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/prasadp4009/.dotfiles.git
```
2. Source genSymLinks.sh
```bash
$ source genSymLinks.sh
```
3. Above command will populate all necessary symlinks in home directory.

**Note:** Make sure you create backup of your own files before symlinks are created. I will not be responsible for any damage to your system. Please check license before use.
